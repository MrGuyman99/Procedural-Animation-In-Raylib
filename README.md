# Procedural Animation In Raylib! 
Using Simple Distance Constraints I want to make an animated snake that follows the cursor and move around procedurally! This whole project was inspired by Rainworld, go check out that game

## Build Instructions:

### Mac + Linux

- Open the root directory
- Type the following commands

```bat
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

The executable should be in the root directory

### Windows
##### (Make Sure CMake & Visual Studio* are installed)

- Download / Clone the repository

This was a test for a larger experiment and I'm pretty happy with where the code is!\
Hope someone can use this for reference :)
